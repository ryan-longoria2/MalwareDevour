# MalwareDevour

Language: Python

To run on MacOS:
  Python3 main.py
  
To run on Windows:
  python main.py

The only button that works is for "Scan Now"
It scans for vulnerable files based on a file's md5sum. However, we only have implemented it to the point where it just collects an md5sum from the same directory as vtscan.py and just display it.
This feature won't work directly from main.py (yet)
To run this feature:
  MacOS:
    Python3 vtscan.py
  
  Windows:
    python vtscan.py
  
We have GUIs for most of the other features, but we ran out of time to link them with our main.py
The GUIs are also placed in the MalwareDevour.zip
